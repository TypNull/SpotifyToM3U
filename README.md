# Spotify Playlist to M3U8 Converter

Welcome to the Spotify Playlist Converter application! This WPF application is designed to help you convert your Spotify playlists into M3U8 playlist files that can be played on your local PC.

To get started, you don't need to have a Spotify account. Search for public playlists you like and once you have your playlists ready, you can use the Spotify Playlist Converter to convert them into M3U8 files that can be played on your local PC.

The application uses the Spotify API to access your playlists and retrieve the track information. It then searches your local PC for the corresponding music files and creates an M3U8 playlist file that can be played in your favorite media player.

Select the playlist you want to convert and click the "Convert" button. The application will then search your local PC for the corresponding music files and create an M3U8 playlist file. You can also choose the format of the audio files that should be searched.
